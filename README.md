# Web-Development-project
Amazon Webpage for Beauty Products
This project is a beginner-level webpage inspired by Amazon, specifically focused on showcasing beauty products. The webpage is built using HTML and CSS, and serves as a simple, static representation of a product listing page. As a beginner, I focused on creating a clean layout, organizing product , and designing a responsive page that can adapt to different screen sizes.
Key Features:
Simple structure using HTML for content layout.
Responsive design with CSS for a clean and accessible user interface.
Focused on showcasing beauty products with placeholders for images, descriptions, and prices.
This project helped me strengthen my foundational skills in web development, and I am continuing to enhance it with more advanced features.
